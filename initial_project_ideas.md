Capstone 2 Ideas

1. Trading Card Website/Marketplace where users can “buy”, “sell”, and trade cards from multiple franchises using a VC created for the site. Users can register/login view their collection as well as buy/sell cards from it via the “marketplace”. Cards in the marketplace can be filtered by their respective franchises as well as rarity price etc. Users can communicate with one another via messaging to broker deals for cards as well as rate cards on rarity, value, popularity etc to influence pricing.

 2. Food Recipe Website with integrated online grocery store. Users can register/login, browse recipes with detailed nutrition facts, save recipes to a favorites list or add them directly to a cart that will populate the corresponding ingredients from the integrated store. Users can also browse and shop within the online store normally.

3. Travel Planning Website that cross references available flights, lodging, attractions with weather to help plan the optimal trip. Allows users to compare fares across multiple airlines and hotels to find the best deal on their requested travel package as well as check the weather forecast for the duration of the trip if applicable.
