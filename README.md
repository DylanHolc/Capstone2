This project is a spoof of a card exchange website that sells trading cards from popular TCG franchises like Pokemon allowing users to enjoy a realistic browsing and purchasing experience with high quality visuals and a well designed layout and UI system.

-Browse different collections of cards from various franchises
-Add items to the cart accurately displaying the total price and quantity
-Place orders that accurately effect the stock of the cards purchased and will be saved to their profile if logged in at the time of purchase
-Access a profile page displaying their information as well as their order history
-Browse all the cards of a specific franchise through paginated result pages
-Login, logout, edit, and delete their account seamlessly
-Use various buttons and links to access third party websites

--Javascript
--React
--Sequelize
